# DotNetMastery's EF Core (MVC) Complete Demonstration Project
# A Complete MVC Solution using EF Capabilities

This project is my actual full implementation of DotNetMastery's WizLibSolution.

This is a 3-tier Solution consisting of projects comprising
a) Program.cs / Views / Controllers, b) a Data Access Layer containing connection to db information as well as all migrations,
c) a project consisting of a list of Models and View Models.

The many features of EF Core are explored in this project through various examples.

## Foundational Topics in EF Core
Some of these are: Defining the N-Tier Architecture of the project, defining the connection information (dbcontext) and required packages, 
working with migrations and migration commands, working with data annotations and establishing data relations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
with data annotations and navigation property configuration, working with the fluent API as an alternative and also as last resort as
well as extablishing data relations through fluent API, working with CRUD and Bulk Crud operations, and other topics which include

## Intermediate Topics
- projections
- eager loading
- deferred execution
- IEnumerable vs IQueryable
- Attach vs Update
- Manually altering states

## Advanced Topics
The solution also reviews topics such as a full implementation of a many-to-many relation, multi-level explicit loading and advanced eager loading.
Finally, there is a brief introduction to several other advanced topics such as tracking, working with views, raw sql and stored procedures and filters.
this is a near-exhaustive list, an introductory outline of what can be found in this project.
